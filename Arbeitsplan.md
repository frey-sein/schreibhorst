# Schreibhorst

## About
Schreibhorst is a content creation assistant that combines conversational AI with powerful content generation capabilities. The application features a dual-panel interface with a chat interface on the left and a "stage" on the right. 

Users can research topics through natural conversation (utilizing MCP tools under the hood like scraping, web research, etc.) and then move the resulting prompts to the stage where they are executed to generate various types of content (images, text, video, etc.). This content can then be assembled into posts for social media platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, and website blogs (e.g., WordPress).
